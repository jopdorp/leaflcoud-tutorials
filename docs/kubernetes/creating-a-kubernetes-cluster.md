# Creating a Kubernetes cluster

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a new Kubernetes cluster, using the OpenStack CLI. Container clusters are deployed and managed by the OpenStack Magnum project. You can use these clusters to deploy reproducible high-availability services and infrastructures 

To get started, you'll need to have the OpenStack CLI set up: You can find a tutorial on how to do that in the *Getting Started* section

Additionally, you'll need the Kubectl. This allows you to deploy your applications as a cluster. Make sure it's the same version as used in the cluster you are deploying:

```
sudo snap install kubectl --channel=1.18/stable --classic
```

## Configure the OpenStack CLI 

Inside your virtual enviroment install the magnum client:

```
pip install python-openstackclient python-magnumclient 
```

Then check if you are able to reach the server list using OpenStack CLI: 

```
openstack server list 
```
If you get an authentication error, run: 
```
source leafcloudopenrc.sh 
```
again and make sure your password is correct

## Choose a template

 You can find a list of the various templates by entering the following: 

```
openstack coe cluster template list
``` 
 
Choose the one that best fits your needs. In this tutorial we'll be using:
`k8s-fedora-coreos-32-ha-octavia-ingress`

The template that we're going to use has support for:
- ingress load balancing based on octavia high availability load balancers.
- autoscaling using the kubernetes openstack autoscaler driver
- encrypted cinder volumes for both hosts and containers i.e. persistent volume claims 

We support our pre-configured templates, if you want to use custom templates or custom labels, you can, but it might not work and we're unable to support it.

## Create a Cluster 

Now that we have chosen a template we can create a new cluster, with --keypair we select the keypair that will be added to the hosts, so you can access the hosts root over SSH. (default user is 'core')

```
openstack coe cluster create my-k8s-cluster --cluster-template k8s-fedora-coreos-32-ha-octavia-ingress --keypair <keypair>  
```

This process may take a few minutes. To check up on the installation enter the following: 

``` 
openstack coe cluster list 
``` 
![creating-a-kubernetes-cluster](../images/kubernetes-cluster-1.png)

When the status changes from CREATE_IN_PROGRESS to CREATE_COMPLETE the installation is complete. Next, you can retrieve the config: 

```
openstack coe cluster config my-k8s-cluster
``` 

This will download a file called 'config' to your home directory. 

``` 
export KUBECONFIG=/home/<username>/config 
```

The config is now usable by kubectl and you should be able to reach your cluster by entering: 

```
kubectl get nodes -o wide 
```

Finally, we can configure the storage class to enable usage of persistent volume claims. First, create the storageclass.yaml file:

```
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
 name: cinder-csi
 labels:
 storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
provisioner: cinder.csi.openstack.org
```

Then apply it:

```
kubectl apply -f storageclass.yaml
```

You have now created a kubernetes cluster using the CLI. 

Please note that only the creator of a cluster can delete it by entering the following:

```
openstack coe cluster delete my-k8s-cluster
```
If you are no longer able to access the required account to delete a cluster, contact leafcloud for support.
